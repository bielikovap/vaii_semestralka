                Seven students are avoiding going to school, hiding in their darkened bedrooms, unable to face their
                family and friends, until the moment they discover a portal into another world that offers temporary
                escape from their stressful lives. Passing through a glowing mirror, they gather in a magnificent castle
                which becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. The students are tasked with locating a
                key, hidden somewhere in the castle, that will allow whoever finds it to be granted one wish. At this
                moment, the castle will vanish, along with all memories they may have of their adventure. If they fail
                to leave the castle by 5 pm every afternoon, they will be eaten by the keeper of the castle, an easily
                provoked and shrill creature named the Wolf Queen.

                Delving into their emotional lives with sympathy and a generous warmth, Lonely Castle in the Mirror
                shows the unexpected rewards of reaching out to others. Exploring vivid human stories with a twisty and
                puzzle-like plot, this heart-warming novel is full of joy and hope for anyone touched by sadness and
                vulnerability.
