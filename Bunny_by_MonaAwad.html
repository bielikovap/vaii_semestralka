                We were just these innocent girls in the night trying to make something beautiful. We nearly died. We
                very nearly did, didn't we?
                <br><br>
                Samantha Heather Mackey couldn't be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at
                New England's Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination
                to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort--a clique of
                unbearably twee rich girls who call each other Bunny, and seem to move and speak as one.
                <br><br>
                But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies' fabled Smut Salon, and finds
                herself inexplicably drawn to their front door--ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process. As
                Samantha plunges deeper and deeper into the Bunnies' sinister yet saccharine world, beginning to take
                part in the ritualistic off-campus Workshop where they conjure their monstrous creations, the edges of
                reality begin to blur. Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly
                collision.
                <br><br>
                The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the female experience, Bunny is
                a down-the-rabbit-hole tale of loneliness and belonging, friendship and desire, and the fantastic and
                terrible power of the imagination.
